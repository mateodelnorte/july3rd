# July3rd - Getting Rolling w/ Node
=======
Purpose of this talk: Show how easy it is to create a stable deployed environment for development w/ Node. 

What we'll go over: 

 - Part 1: Learning to Walk: Create express app and deploy on heroku. Super simple. Takes 3 mins, tops. 
 - Part 2: Growing up: Provision (or use already provisioned) EC2 instance. Introduce 'deploy' and 'forever'. Use both to deploy our app to EC2 and guarantee it stays live. 
 - Part 3: Scaling out: Using child_process to do long running worker tasks
 - Part 4: Scaling far-out, man: Using RabbitMQ (but could be any other messaging medium) and multiple processes to make an event-based system

# Learning to Walk / Bootstrapping w/ Heroku

Create express app and deploy on heroku. Super simple. Takes 3 mins, tops.

Pre-reqs - Install this: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-command

- Create a new folder for your app, run express (first run npm install express -g, if you don't already have it)

# Growing up 

Provision (or use already provisioned) EC2 instance. Introduce 'deploy' and 'forever'. Use both to deploy our app to EC2 and guarantee it stays live.


# Scaling out 

Using child_process to do long running worker tasks

# Scaling far-out, man

Using RabbitMQ (but could be any other messaging medium) and multiple processes to make an event-based system
