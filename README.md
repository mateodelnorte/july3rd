Get Up and Rolling

Purpose of the talk: Show how easy it is to create a stable deployed environment for development w/ Node. 

Part 1: Learning to Walk: Create express app and deploy on heroku. Super simple. Takes 3 mins, tops. 
Part 2: Growing up: Provision (or use already provisioned) EC2 instance. Introduce 'deploy' and 'forever'. Use both to deploy our app to EC2 and guarantee it stays live. 
Part 3: Scaling out: Using child_process to do long running worker tasks
Part 4: Scaling far-out, man: Using RabbitMQ (but could be any other messaging medium) and multiple processes to make an event-based system
